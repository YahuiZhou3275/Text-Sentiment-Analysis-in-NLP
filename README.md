# Text-Sentiment-Analysis-in-NLP

## Introduction 
The project will involve investigating the following datasets:
There are three sentiment Labelled Sentences Data Set, which contains sentences labelled with positive or negative sentiment.respectively from IMDB, Amazon and Yelp.

The goal of this project is to build and evaluate classifiers to predict the sentiment of a given sentence. The true label of each sentence is binary (i.e., positive vs negative) and given in the dataset. We use the overall offline/online efficiency and accuracy as metrics.

In this project, I implemented Multinomial Naive Bayes on my own and use free packages for the other (Multinomial Naive Bayes (for checking) / Decision Tree / KNN / SVM)
